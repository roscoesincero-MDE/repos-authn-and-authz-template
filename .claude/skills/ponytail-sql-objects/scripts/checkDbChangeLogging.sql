Script:         checkDbChangeLogging.sql
Purpose:        Read-only pre-flight report on the DDL change-logging subsystem in the current database, and on the two
                application table shapes whose audit trail depends on an object the engine will not supply by itself.
                Answers one question -- is it here, is it complete, and is it current -- and prescribes the fix for
                anything it is not.  Changes nothing.

                The table-shape checks are here rather than in a file of their own so that there is a single health
                check to run, and because README.md's troubleshooting table already tells the reader this script names
                a missing or disabled audit trigger.
Target:         SQL Server 2022 -- the project floor, stated once in SKILL.md rule 6.  Nothing in this file needs
                anything newer than 2017, but do not re-declare a lower floor here: templates/procedure.sql uses
                LEAST(), which is 2022+, so a procedure built to this skill's conventions will not compile below it.
Run as:         Any principal with VIEW DEFINITION or membership of logsAuditReader.  A principal that cannot see
                catalog metadata reads a healthy database as an empty one, so do not run this as an application login.
Companion:      scripts/logdBChanges.sql applies everything this script reports as missing or out of date, and is safe
                to run against a database that is already correct.

Why this is all catalog queries
-------------------------------
Every check reads sys.* only.  Nothing here names a column of logsData.DdlChange in a FROM clause, deliberately: a
column reference is bound when the batch is compiled, not when the IF around it is evaluated, so one static SELECT
against a table that does not exist yet -- or that exists without the audit block -- would fail the whole report on
exactly the database that needs it most.

What a clean report does not prove
----------------------------------
That the audit trail is intact.  This script checks that the machinery is in place; logs.uspDdlAuditVerify checks
whether it has been tampered with (empty history on the append-only log, no soft-deleted event rows, versioning still
on).  Run both: this one before deploying, that one after, and from a monitoring job thereafter.

========================================================================================================================
Example Usage and Performance:

sqlcmd -S <server> -d <database> -I -C -i checkDbChangeLogging.sql

This file reads whichever database -d selected; it has no USE and no :setvar of its own, so there is nothing here to
get out of step with the command line.  Its companion does: logdBChanges.sql names its target in a :setvar and
asserts it before changing anything, so run that one as

    sqlcmd -S <server> -d <database> -v DbName=<database> -I -C -i logdBChanges.sql

Catalog reads only.  Milliseconds, no locks worth naming, safe on a production instance during business hours.

Modification History:

Date:       2026-09-12
Author:     rsincero
Ticket:     N/A
Description:
Created, alongside the temporal conversion of the logging tables.

Date:       2026-09-13
Author:     rsincero
Ticket:     N/A
Description:
Code-review fixes.  Status now always agrees with Severity, and the summary counts the same buckets it prints.  Added
the INSTEAD OF trigger enablement check -- existence was being checked, enablement was not, on either side.  The
audit*By width check now tests against the standard 255 rather than 128.

Date:       2026-09-13
Author:     rsincero
Ticket:     N/A
Description:
Added the application table shape checks, which widens this file's scope past the change-logging subsystem: a plain
table carrying the audit block with no AFTER UPDATE trigger, one whose trigger is DISABLED, one whose trigger is named
off-convention, and a system-versioned base table sitting outside a *Data schema where it can never be given a view
wrapper.  README.md documented the first two as findings of this script before they were implemented.
